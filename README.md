# Sherlock Holmes Recurrent Neural Network

In this project I use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on the Complete Works of Sherlock Holmes to generate text in the form of Sherlock Holmes. 

The RNN I trained used two hidden layers with 100 neurons each. Through numerous tests this seemed to be the ideal setup for the network and it was able to quickly train on the data and begin generating impressive responses. 

The final results and code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/J-Singletary/SherlockHolmesGeneration-RNN/blob/main/Altered%20Char-RNN.ipynb), while the training data can be viewed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J-Singletary/SherlockHolmesGeneration-RNN/main/sherlock.txt).
